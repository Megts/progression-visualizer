# progression-visualizer
Program to scrap TFRRS in order to visualize individual and team race progression in user specified events during the athletes collegiate career. The script to run the program is tfrrs/progression-visualizer.py from here. The three python scripts here are smaller scripts for us to get used to matplotlib and PyQt5. The spider to collect data can be ran when in the first tfrrs folder in a command shell using the command   scrapy crawl runner. The database ended up being to large for git so it can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jPNA6SuEnelLwBxSXfHx45mkygkNh-_7/view?usp=sharing. Put this database as ncaa.db in the tfrrs folder with progression-visualizer.py and ncaa_db_queries.py. If there are any further questions or an athlete is missing data you can write to maegts@hotmail.com and I will try my best to fix issues in a timely manner. I will also try to update the db after every national championship (xc, indoor, and outdoor). As of right now the athletes were on a roster for the 2021 outdoor season, getting past seasons is a task I/we haven't gotten around to.
